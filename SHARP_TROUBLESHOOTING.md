# üîß Sharp Library Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem
The Sharp library fails to load on Windows with the error:
```
Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the win32-x64 runtime
ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED: The specified procedure could not be found.
```

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Reinstall Sharp with Optional Dependencies
```bash
cd flask-server
npm uninstall sharp
npm install --include=optional sharp
```

### Solution 2: Clear npm Cache and Reinstall
```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Solution 3: Install Platform-Specific Version
```bash
npm install --os=win32 --cpu=x64 sharp
```

### Solution 4: Use Alternative Image Processing
The application now includes fallback support for Jimp:
```bash
npm install jimp
```

### Solution 5: Manual Sharp Installation
```bash
# Remove existing sharp
npm uninstall sharp

# Install sharp with specific version
npm install sharp@latest

# If that fails, try installing with specific platform
npm install --platform=win32 --arch=x64 sharp
```

### Solution 6: Check Node.js Version Compatibility
Sharp requires specific Node.js versions. Try:
```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version

# If using Node.js 22+, try downgrading to Node.js 18 LTS
# Download from: https://nodejs.org/
```

### Solution 7: Install Visual Studio Build Tools
On Windows, you might need Visual Studio Build Tools:
```bash
# Install windows-build-tools (run as administrator)
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

### Solution 8: Use Docker (Alternative)
If all else fails, use Docker to avoid platform-specific issues:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Current Application Status

‚úÖ **The application now works without Sharp!**

The application has been updated to:
- Try loading Sharp first
- Fall back to Jimp if Sharp fails
- Use original image buffer if both fail
- Display which processing method was used

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd flask-server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   node test-app.js
   ```

3. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

## Expected Output

When the server starts, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Sharp library loaded successfully
```
OR
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Sharp library failed to load: [error message]
‚úÖ Jimp library loaded successfully as fallback
```
OR
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Sharp library failed to load: [error message]
‚ö†Ô∏è Jimp library also failed to load: [error message]
üìù Continuing without image resizing capabilities
```

## Performance Notes

- **With Sharp**: Best performance, optimal image resizing
- **With Jimp**: Good performance, slower than Sharp but functional
- **Without processing**: Works but may be slower with large images

## Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Try the solutions in order
3. Consider using Docker for consistent environment
4. Report issues with your Node.js version and OS details
